#assert - The assert statement verifies that the expression defined resolves to true. 
#If it does not it will raise an AssertionError with an optional expression2.
#used as a convenient way to debug something

assert True
assert False 


#pass - A null operation. When this is executed nothing happens.
#usually used a placeholder when a statement is required but no code needs to happen yes

def function():
	pass 


#except - When a try statement fails, the except catches the failure and returns.

def divide(n, n2):
	except ZeroDivisionError:
		print("division by zero!")

#class - An object that contains functions and can be instantiated. A way to take a grouping 
#of functions and data and place them inside a container so you can access them with a '.'
#operator 

#exec - Allows for the dynamic execution of Python code. Execute code.
#found out that the exec function can be used to call terminal functions like ls or cd?
#Much of the documentation actually
#argues against using exec. From what I understand it seems to allow you to call a piece
#of code after it is created whilst something else is being run?

#Below example in python terminal
>>> mycode = 'print "hello world"'
>>> exec(mycode)
Hello world

#raise - Used to call an exception that can be customized per situation.
#intended to signal an error situation and meant to check for it. 

if (a < b):
	raise ValueErrror()

#continue -Skip the rest of the current loop and continue loop cycle.

#this will print our all the letters except for h (PYTON)
for letter in 'Python':     
   if letter == 'h':
      continue
   print 'Current Letter :', letter

#try and finally

#try - Specifies exception handlers and/or cleanup code for a group of statements.
#finally -The finally statement is the cleanup function in a 'try' statement. While all 
#of the try... except... else are executed, if an exception is raised it is parsed and printed 
#in the finally statement. This also causes any application that is preemptively interrupted to 
#still execute the finally statement before closing out of the loop.

#example below will always print "printy"
def fav_number():
        try:
                response = int(raw_input("What's your favorite number"))
        except StandardError, e:
                print "Error - ",e
        finally:
                print "printy"
        print response
        return response

#lambda- Creates an anonymous function that is not bound to a specific namespace.
#mostly used when we require a nameless function for a short amount of time

double = lambda x: x * 2

#almost the same as 

def double(x):
   return x * 2


String Escape Sequences

String Formats
 • %d - signed decimal 
 • %i - signed decimal (same as %d)
 • %o - octal
 • %u - signed decimal (obsolete)
 • %x - signed hex, lowercase
 • %X - signed hex, uppercase
 • %e - floating point in exponential format, lowercase
 • %E - floating point in exponential format, uppercase
 • %f - floating point in decimal format
 • %F - floating point in decimal format 
 • %g - floating point format if less than 
 • %G - floating point uppercase exponential is less than -4, decimal format
 		otherwise
 • %c - single character
 • %r - string, converts using repr(), "x"
 • %s - string, converts using str(), x 
 • %% - no argument converted. results in '%' in the result


 Operators
 • + 
 • -
 • *
 • ** - exponentiation 
 • / - divide
 • // - quotient, division without any remainder
 • % - modulo, sets remainder 
 • <
 • >
 • <=
 • >=
 • ==
 • !=
 • <>
 • ( ) - tuple
 • [ ] - list
 • { } - set 
 • @ - #missed this one!
 #this is defined as a decorator; pie syntax
 #this allows you to decorate a function with another function

 @login_required
 def my_function():
 	pass

 #is equivalent to 

 def my_function():
 	pass
 my function = login_required(my_function)
 • ,
 • :
 • =
 • ;
 • += - add and assignment operater. add right operand to the left and assigns
 		the result to the left operand 
 		ex. c += a is equivalent to c = c + a 
 • -= - subtract and assignment operator. subtracts right operand from the left
 		and assigns the result to the left operand 
 		ex. c -= a is equivalent to c = c -a 
 • *= - multiply and assignment operator, mutliplies the right and the left and 
 		assigns the result to the left
 		ex. c = a is equivlaent to c = c * a 
 • /= - c/=a is equivalent to c = c/a 
 • //=  c//=a is equavlent to c = c//a #this results in a whole number as opposed to float like above
 • %= 	^
 • **=  c **= a is equivalent to c = c**a. The ** is raising it to the a exponent.
 - *=   c *= a is equivalent to c = c * a. This is multiplication function.
