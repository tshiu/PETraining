# General thoughts:
# Self is used extensively in both bits of code, however, when i looked it up here:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2709821/what-is-the-purpose-of-self, I'm not quite sure
# I understand it completely. 
# Curious to see when this concept is explained and would be a good point for discussion.
