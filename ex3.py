#SD
# 1. Above
# 2. I typed 'python' and did a few calculations. It works!
# 3. I wasn't sure what this prompt meantâ€” did it want a simple calucation? I just picked
#    a random calculation

#    print "What is 55 * 55?", 55 * 55
# 4. Floating point numbers are numbers with increased precision as they have numbers 
#    after the decimal place; non-integers
# 5. Rewritten above. I replaced the calculated numbers.
