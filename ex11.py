#Study Drills
#1. pydoc raw_input 
#Help on built-in function raw_input in module __builtin__:

#raw_input(...)
    #raw_input([prompt]) -> string

#2. Yes!
#3. pydoc is a documentation generator and help system; basically like a dictionary
#4. Read through the documentation. Not quite clear yet but good context?
#open - Open a file using the file() type, returns a file object
# 	OS imports specific operating system functionality 
#  Sys - "system specifc parameters?" - unsure of this one right now
