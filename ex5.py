#Study Drills
#1. Changed all the variables without the my above.
#2. Looked this up in google and this was the answer I received: The difference between %s and %r is that 
#   %s uses the str function and %r uses the repr function. for built-in types, the biggest difference in 
#   practice is that repr for strings includes quotes and all special characters are escaped.
#3. Looked onlineâ€” https://docs.python.org/2.4/lib/typesseq-strings.html. Will reference this as it comes.
#4.
