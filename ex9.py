# Here's some new strange stuff, remember to type it exactly.

#I believe this is setting days as the string
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"

#should print out the months vertically
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

print "Here are the days: ", days
print "Here are the months: ", months 

#the triple double=quotes prints across multiple lines 
#instead of before where the comma needed to be added to cheeseburger
print """
